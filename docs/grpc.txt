GRPC is compared to be more faster mode of communication than REST Protocol
* Experienced 7 times faster than REST while receiving and 10 times faster than REST while sending
* Also it validates the users payload and gurantees the type of data is exepected or not

In this proto the request is expected to recieve in int32 format for pid,latitude,longitude fields
This message is validated and will be produced to a kafka topic

message LocationMessage {
  int32 pid = 1;
  int32 latitude = 94;
  int32 longitude = 98;
}

service LocationService {
  rpc Create(LocationMessage) returns (LocationMessage);
}
